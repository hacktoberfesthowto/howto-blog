### Hello world!

This site exists to help you make the most of `Hacktoberfest`, which typically occurs on GitHub during the month of October. Information for the current year is typically available on the [Hacktoberfest website](https://hacktoberfest.com/).

# Hacktoberfest: A HOWTO
Here are some best practices for creating issues that encourage people to give useful PRs in response. Because Hacktoberfest is a unique time of year that brings new folks to open source repositories, take special care to minimize confusion and frustration.

This repo contains tips for two sets of folks: 
* Repo owners that create issues and handle incoming pull requests
* Hacktoberfest participants that want to use the allure of a comfy free t-shirt to try out contributing to open source.
